<h1>Team Innocent: The Point of No Return</h1>
<img width="165" height="165" align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/TeamInnocent-EnglishPatchPCFX/blob/main/cover.png?raw=true">English translation patch for "Team Innocent: The Point of No Return" on the NEC PC-FX.
<br><br>
"Team Innocent: The Point of No Return" is set in the future, beginning with the Galactic Police discovering that a scientist named Cronus has conducted genetic experiments on human beings. The police chief rescues three little girls, each of whom bears the traces of these experiments. Fast-forward fifteen years: the three young women - Saki, Lilis, and Ariel - now work for the Galactic Police, determined to find the truth behind their origins, and the nature of the experiments. They are sent on three dangerous missions - missions they might not survive...
<br><br>
"Team Innocent: The Point of No Return" is an adventure game with action elements. The game consists of three missions. The player controls Saki most of the time, but other girls temporarily become available as playable characters as well. The heroine must explore a large location, collecting items and solving a few puzzles on the way. The young women can also find and equip various weapons, from pistols to axes. The player can choose one of the four action modes: punching, kicking, shooting, and (in specific instances only) jumping. The girls are navigated from third-person perspective on pre-rendered backgrounds with constantly changing camera angles, similarly to the "Alone in the Dark" games, except for the protagonists being sprites and not 3D models. The game has a few anime-style cutscenes and voice-overs for dialogues.
